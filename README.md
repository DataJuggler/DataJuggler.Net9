11.14.2023: DataJuggler.NET8 is has been released!

8.9.2023: .NET 8 has been released. All the code is the same as the .NET 7 version, except some of the features
for DataTier.Net have been removed as the DataWatcher.cs class is no longer created.

DataJuggler.Net 8 will power the following projects by November. Currently these projects are on .NET 7.

DB Compare
https://github.com/DataJuggler/DBCompare

DB Compare reads the database schema and compares two SQL Server databases and displays a report
of any schema differences. The generate scripts feature is a work in progress.

Another project that uses this and is open source is:

DataJuggler.Excelerate
https://github.com/DataJuggler/Excelerate

Nuget DataJuggler.Excelerate

Live Demo
https://excelerate.datajuggler.com

Code Generate C# Classes From Excel Header Rows

Blazor Source Code For Above Site

Blazor Excelerate

https://github.com/DataJuggler/Blazor.Excelerate

And my latest project is SQL Snapshot

Nuget DataJuggler.SQLSnapshot
https://github.com/DataJuggler/SQLSnapshot

Export an entire SQL Server database to Excel including all rows with 3 lines of code.

Another site that is powered by an earlier version of DataJuggler.NET8 is, and is my favorite project.

DataTier.Net
https://github.com/DataJuggler/DataTier.Net

DataTier.Net is an Entity Framework alternative that uses all stored procedures.

If you feel any of the projects are worth the price of free, please leave a star on Git Hub and / or
subscribe to my YouTube channel.
